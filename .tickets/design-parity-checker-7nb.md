# Error rendering UX: map DpcError to user-facing JSON/pretty with remediation

Error rendering UX: map DpcError into user-facing JSON/pretty with categories (config/network/figma/image/metric), remediation hints, and consistent exit codes. Integrate with CLI scaffolding so errors are friendly and actionable. Acceptance: same error renders consistently across formats with a suggested fix.
