# Docs & samples: premium-grade CLI guidance and walkthroughs

Premium docs & samples: concise, Stripe-quality CLI guidance for compare/generate-code/quality with end-to-end examples, sample outputs (JSON/pretty), config flags, artifact locations, and troubleshooting (timeouts, resource detection, missing node-id). Acceptance: a short doc users can follow to run a parity check confidently with expected outputs shown.
