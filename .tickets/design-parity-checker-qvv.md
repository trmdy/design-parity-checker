# Implement --keep-artifacts flag

When enabled, preserve intermediate files: screenshots, DOM JSON snapshots, Figma JSON, diff heatmaps. Store in temp directory or specified output path.

## Notes

Completed: keep-artifacts implemented; ChartreusePond reports artifacts preserved via --keep-artifacts/--artifacts-dir with docs/tests.
