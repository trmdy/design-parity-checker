# Improve error clarity & remediation

Map common failures to actionable messages: Playwright/Node missing (install hint), missing FIGMA_TOKEN/node-id/file-key, capture timeouts (suggest timeout flags), missing file/unsupported ext (list supported). Ensure JSON/pretty include hints; keep exit 2. Add coverage tests.
