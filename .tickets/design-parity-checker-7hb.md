# Output/report contract: define JSON schema, pretty mode, artifact path surfacing

Define and implement output/report contract: JSON schema for success (scores, diffs, artifact paths) and errors; pretty mode mirrors JSON; sample payloads documented. Surface artifact locations (screenshots/DOM/diffs) in verbose mode. Acceptance: documented schema version, CLI emits structured outputs, and users can locate artifacts easily.
