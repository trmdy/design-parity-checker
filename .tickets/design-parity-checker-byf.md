# Implement DOM snapshot extraction

During URL rendering, extract: node tree (tag, attributes, text), bounding boxes in viewport coordinates, computed styles for key properties (font-family, font-size, font-weight, color, background-color, line-height).

## Notes

DOM snapshot extractor implemented; computed styles extended with display/visibility/opacity; tests added
