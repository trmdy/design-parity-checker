# Resource detection UX: resilient type detection and actionable error messages

Improve resource detection UX: case-insensitive image extensions, file existence checks with helpful hints, clearer URL/Figma parsing errors, and remediation tips (e.g., add file://, correct node-id). Surface detected kind in verbose output. Acceptance: users get actionable errors and the detected resource type is logged; no silent mis-detections.
