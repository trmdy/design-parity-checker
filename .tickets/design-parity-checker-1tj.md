# Unify docs and status banner

Add status banner to README (compare partial; generate/quality stubs; capture requires Node/Playwright/FIGMA_TOKEN). Cross-link docs (reporting, metrics_overview, normalized_view, ci_cheatsheet, dev_setup). Ensure flags/behavior match current code; call out exit codes and mock env vars.
