# Capture pipeline UX: progress logging and timeout defaults in browser capture

Capture pipeline UX: provide a single capture helper that logs stages (browser launch, nav, network-idle, screenshot/DOM), honors Config timeouts, and returns user-friendly progress/errors. Coordinate with bd-a1o implementation and output schema so artifacts are surfaced. Acceptance: capture API yields clear progress logs and respects configured timeouts.
