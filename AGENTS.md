# Design parity checker

This is the repository for the tool "dpc", Design Parity Checker. The goal of the tool is to provide a utility for comapring the likeness of two images representing an implemented design of an app, webapp or website.

This makes it possible to automatically evaluate how precise an LLM (or human) has been in their implementation work against a reference.
